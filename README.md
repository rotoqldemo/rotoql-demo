For the sake of the demo, here are the hardcoded values of the `env` vars needed to run or build the app:

```bash
export REACT_APP_API_HOST="https://api-qa.squadql.com/graphql"
export REACT_APP_API_TOKEN="f1432e0d-557d-466f-877c-8fc6631e7594 1209600.DYMwsQ.H7GDNVW3KLgA7XCrP6y18v1Fl20"
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
